# Lists of differentially expressed genes

FILE LIST WITH DESCRIPTIONS
------------------------------------

**DEG_A1ud.txt**  - list of differentially expressed genes with log fold change (logFC) and adjusted p-value (padj) for the comparison between higher (u = up) and lower (d = down) elevation in the alpine (A) ecotype of pair 1.

**DEG_A1vsM1d.txt** - list of differentially expressed genes with log fold change (logFC) and adjusted p-value (padj) for the comparison between alpine and montane (M) ecotypes of pair 1 when grown at the lower elevation.

**DEG_A1vsM1u.txt** - list of differentially expressed genes with log fold change (logFC) and adjusted p-value (padj) for the comparison between alpine and montane ecotypes of pair 1 when grown at the higher elevation.

**DEG_A3ud.txt**  - list of differentially expressed genes with log fold change (logFC) and adjusted p-value (padj) for the comparison between higher and lower elevation in the alpine (A) ecotype of pair 3.
